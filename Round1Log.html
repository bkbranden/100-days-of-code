<p data-line="4" class="code-line"><strong>Today's Progress</strong>: Finished customizing the Slate docs template that I utilized to have a static-site generator to output my notes. I configured so that it will be directly portable to the syntax and way that I write my notes in markdown so that I don't have to change anything syntax or file related in my markdown files when I am taking notes without a server. Also, I got through several hours of competitive coding practice as well as understanding one of the Codeforces problems which was on maximizing the min and max weights given to k people out of n integers. Also, I got started on Project Euler. Currently, trying to figure out a good and time efficient way to personalize the coding practice I do and make real-world applications.</p>
<p data-line="6" class="code-line"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> This was not something that I planned to work on but I got distracted and had to make some progress on this since I think it will help me in the long run. Also, I am excited to grind on the competitive programming daily since I think it will be very useful to me in the long-run. I was thinking about a good way to personalize the problems that I solve and common patterns. Upon further thinking, it might be better to not find applications of a coding problem but rather dive deeper into the core algorithm and principles utilized within the algorithm as that is what translate to other problems most of the time.</p>

<p data-line="10" class="code-line"><strong>Today's Progress</strong>: Today, switched it up to learn and practice more machine learning. I got a dataset from the UCI ML database. Using one of their datasets designed for classification, I classified the type of wine based on parameters utilizing the K-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm that I learned previously. Probably because the dataset was designed for classification, the results were very accurate with over 90% accuracy.</p>
<p data-line="12" class="code-line"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> This was super interesting because it was one of the first projects that I tried to utilize what I learned in ML without having to look at a guide or tutorial. This helped me understand what type of datasets and problems are solved with KNN as well as how to clean up datasets and convert them in a format that you need.</p>

<p data-line="18" class="code-line"><strong>Today's Progress</strong>: Started tackling adding more features into the frontend. Because I want the frontend architecture to be up to date and simple, I decided to utilize the React-Router for navigation as well as Redux for state management of trhings that exist throughout the whole app such as admin and login functionality. I integrated React Router, but right now I am writing the basics for the Redux integration. So far, I have only written the action types and creators, but am going to tackle the reducers and then the store so that I can hook it up with the React router</p>
<p data-line="20" class="code-line"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> Hooking up the React Router and the Redux was much easier this time around than before. One main problem that I ran into was how to best organize the code. Because there isn't any guides organizing was something that took some time for me to figure out how I best wanted it. Furthermore, because this time around I am utilizing Typescript, the type definitions are definitely something to get used to.</p>

<p data-line="26" class="code-line"><strong>Today's Progress</strong>: Today I added the draw logic to the game as well as keeping track of the different states throughout the game and then allowing for resetting back to a previous state. Also, updated some styles on the buttons and the board.</p>
<p data-line="28" class="code-line"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> The keeping track of the state logic actually had a small problem where I would arrays and matricies would be passed by reference when assigned to another variable so when a state was updated, it would override all of the previous states. The workaround was to create copies of the state everytime that I needed it. Also, styling proved to be very limiting. Trying to style having an element in the center with a column to the right of it proved impossible in flexbox. Also, trying to style bottom borders with elements with padding also was impossible to do.</p>

<p data-line="34" class="code-line"><strong>Today's Progress</strong>: Today I added the gameover logic to check if the game is over and also a conditional to prevent any further play when the game is over. Also added the &quot;reset&quot; functionality and &quot;game-over&quot; text!</p>
<p data-line="36" class="code-line"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> These features weren't the hardest to code up, but I could not think of the best way to check if the game is over other than hard-iterating through each row, each column, and each diagonal. Is there a better way to do this or is it not worth spending time thinking over?</p>

<p data-line="42" class="code-line"><strong>Today's Progress</strong>: Today, I added to logic of being able to click &quot;X&quot; and &quot;O&quot; on the tic tac toe board and adding the player 1's turn and player 2's turn. Also, I added the logic of putting in the text for displaying who's turn it was.</p>
<p data-line="44" class="code-line"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> This was pretty rewarding to code up as it is the main logic within the tic-tac-toe game. One thing that took a little bit of thinking to figure out was how to change the board state on-click. I think the best way was to get the row and column index and then mutate a copy and call setState(), but there might be cleaner ways such as using the MouseEvent cursor position with respect to the square position.</p>

<p data-line="51" class="code-line"><strong>Today's Progress</strong>: Today I started reverse engineering the tic-tac-toe React tutorial available <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html" data-href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">here</a>. I thought this would be a good project exercise to solidfy my React skills especially with Typescript as well as I am going to use this as a base when I set up my router and different parts of my website later. Later I envision having a games projects tab that takes the user to all of the games that I have worked on and made.</p>
<p data-line="53" class="code-line"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I actually messed up the CSS modules paradigm that I mentioned in the last log as the file naming convention requires &quot;.module&quot; where you can import the styles as an object. Working with typescript interfaces for the proptypes and statetypes was something I had to brush up on again. Overall, I think I made significant progress and it was very fun!</p>

<p data-line="59" class="code-line"><strong>Today's Progress</strong>: Created a basic navbar styled with CSS. Downloaded node-sass to integrate SCSS with my React project. Utilizing the CSS modules paradigm for better code organization. Included fonts using webfontloader package (works really well).</p>
<p data-line="61" class="code-line"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I struggled with the different syntax with SCSS. It was a very slight difference from traditional CSS which made it harder to debug (strings don't exist in scss files). The webfontloader package that I utilized for the Roboto Mono font works super well and was integrated very easily.</p>

<p data-line="67" class="code-line"><strong>Today's Progress</strong>: Created the Frontend and APIservice containers and linked them together using docker-compose. Created a basic proof of concept of being able to download npm packages by using React-D3-Tree. Started linking the frontend together and will handle the basic homepage.</p>
<p data-line="69" class="code-line"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> Struggled with containerizing the react application because of a bug in the latest version of react-scripts (3.4.1). Also, tried to find some free mock-up resources on sketchappresources but it seems difficult to find some that are minimal but modern.</p>
