<p data-line="4" class="code-line"><strong>Today's Progress</strong>: Created a basic navbar styled with CSS. Downloaded node-sass to integrate SCSS with my React project. Utilizing the CSS modules paradigm for better code organization. Included fonts using webfontloader package (works really well).</p>
<p data-line="6" class="code-line"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I struggled with the different syntax with SCSS. It was a very slight difference from traditional CSS which made it harder to debug (strings don't exist in scss files). The webfontloader package that I utilized for the Roboto Mono font works super well and was integrated very easily.</p>

<p data-line="12" class="code-line"><strong>Today's Progress</strong>: Created the Frontend and APIservice containers and linked them together using docker-compose. Created a basic proof of concept of being able to download npm packages by using React-D3-Tree. Started linking the frontend together and will handle the basic homepage.</p>
<p data-line="14" class="code-line"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> Struggled with containerizing the react application because of a bug in the latest version of react-scripts (3.4.1). Also, tried to find some free mock-up resources on sketchappresources but it seems difficult to find some that are minimal but modern.</p>
