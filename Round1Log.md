# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created the Frontend and APIservice containers and linked them together using docker-compose. Created a basic proof of concept of being able to download npm packages by using React-D3-Tree. Started linking the frontend together and will handle the basic homepage.

**Thoughts:** Struggled with containerizing the react application because of a bug in the latest version of react-scripts (3.4.1). Also, tried to find some free mock-up resources on sketchappresources but it seems difficult to find some that are minimal but modern.
